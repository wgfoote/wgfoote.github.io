      <description>Welcome to this site. You will eventually see that I have interests span many areas including:
Philosophy – of knowledge, of objects, of persons – and ethics and ultimately the various manifestations of spirit in the world
Mathematical, probabilistic and statistical modeling and computing
Art – its practice, influences, history
Linguistics – especially indo-european and semitic languages
Anything else as all knowledge is fair game</description>
