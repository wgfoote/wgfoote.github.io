      <description>The only wayMaterialsA processDemonstrationThe only wayThe only way to learn how to draw is to draw, incessantly, passionately, anything. Drawing is as much about careful and heart-felt observation as anything else.

      <description>Welcome to this site. You will eventually see that I have interests that span many areas including:
Philosophy – of knowledge, of objects, of persons – and ethics and ultimately the various manifestations of spirit in the world
Mathematical, probabilistic and statistical modeling and computing
Art – its practice, influences, history
Linguistics – especially indo-european and semitic languages
Anything else – as all knowledge is fair game</description>
