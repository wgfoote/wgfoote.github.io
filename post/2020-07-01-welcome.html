<ul>
<li><p>Philosophy – of knowledge, of objects, of persons – and ethics and ultimately the various manifestations of spirit in the world</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematical, probabilistic and statistical modeling and computing</p></li>
<li><p>Art – its practice, influences, history</p></li>
<li><p>Linguistics – especially indo-european and semitic languages</p></li>
<li><p>Anything else – as all knowledge is fair game</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together we will traverse these domains, marvel at their connectivity, and I hope together discover new insights in the decisions we all make.</p>
<p>The now current handle on this site is a very short quote from <a href="https://archive.org/details/virgilsneidboo00virg">Vergil Aeneid 4</a> <em>varium et mutabile semper</em> especially in regards to the topics here. While everything seems to be on the move, we should be always be aware, and undertand, a call to action.</p>
