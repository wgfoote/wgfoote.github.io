      <description>I am a Visiting Associate Professor, Accounting, CIS &amp;amp; Law at Manhattan College.
My professional work rides the seams between economics, finance, and underlying value chains, commodities, operations, and strategies. I&amp;rsquo;ve had faculty appointments at Clarkson, Syracuse, and Le Moyne as well as taught finance and economics and worked with evolving online and executive learning programs.
During my career, I helped to build an energy and environment practice in Europe for Ernst &amp;amp; Young, led the quantitative capital markets team at Deloitte, and helped to establish new practices in enterprise risk management at Deloitte, Charles River Associates, and more recently at Alvarez &amp;amp; Marsal.</description>

      <description>The only wayMaterialsA processDemonstrationThe only wayThe only way to learn how to draw is to draw, incessantly, passionately, anything. Drawing is as much about careful and heart-felt observation as anything else. There are practices, some rules, but these are learned along the way, a felt-memory as we touch objects with our minds and feelings, here through the tip of a pencil on a piece of paper.</description>

      <description>Welcome to this site. You will eventually see that I have interests that span many areas including:
Philosophy – of knowledge, of objects, of persons – and ethics and ultimately the various manifestations of spirit in the world
Mathematical, probabilistic and statistical modeling and computing
Art – its practice, influences, history
Linguistics – especially indo-european and semitic languages
Anything else – as all knowledge is fair game</description>
